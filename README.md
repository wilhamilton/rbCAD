# rbCAD
B-REP CAD program built on top of the Open CASCADE kernal and Python OCC.

# Usage
The software, as of v0.1 is not much more than a few functions built on top of Python OCC to meet my needs as a simple CAD editor in the style of OpenSCAD.  As development continues I will refine the GUI and add more "helper" functions to expose more functionality.

# Roadmap
A short list of features I am kicking around:
- ~~GUI: View Cube (similar to SolidWorks, Inventor, Fusion360, etc.)~~
- ~~GUI: Show "feature" tree~~
- GUI: toggle views on/off
- ~~Sketches: Create objecct to store points/edges/etc. before converting to wires~~
- Special features: aka hole wizard type feature creation
- someday assembly type functionality

# Installation
Use Anaconda and follow the instructions for Python OCC installation.  PyQT5 required.
